## Overview

This README provides an overview and key information about the "World Wide Web" PowerPoint presentation. The presentation aims to tell the story of the World Wide Web in approximately 15 slides. It was created as a first-year assignment relevant to Computer Science. The presentation focuses on three central actors in the story:

1. The Institution: CERN Particle Accelerator in Switzerland, where the World Wide Web was conceived and developed.

2. The Visionary: Tim Berners-Lee, credited with creating and pioneering the World Wide Web, laying the foundation for the digital revolution.

3. The World Wide Web itself, a revolutionary and transformative system that has changed the way we interact, access information, and communicate globally.

## Future Plans

While respecting the presentation's narrative, I plan to remake it to improve the visual aspects, such as text size and placement. I aim to create a visually appealing layout with strategic text placement, ensuring that the text is easily readable and appropriately sized for the audience. Additionally, I am considering adding audio to the presentation, where the text will be read out, enhancing the overall experience for the viewers.

This project provides me with an excellent opportunity to enhance my PowerPoint presentation skills, incorporating animations, transitions, and high-quality visuals to create a professional and engaging presentation. By rehearsing and seeking feedback, I aim to deliver a seamless and captivating presentation that effectively communicates the story of the World Wide Web.
